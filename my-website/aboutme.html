  <h1>So...About Me</h1>
 <p>My life is easily compared to songs that I listen to because they tell a
 story.</p>

 <p>I have been moving from house to house since I was 3 years old. My parents
 have seperated by then. I would go from having a calm and easily going enviroment
 to a strict and angry enviroment. I never minded because I understood that no matter
 what they both loved me equally.</p>

<p>Around 7 years later, my mom had been in a relationship and had my baby brother Leonardo.
It wasn't easy because his father left us and we had to handle being on our own. My brother can be a little
over whelming because he doesn't listen and struggles to see far away, but I still love him because he is half my blood. He 
is still growing now and he is very funny when he wants to be.</p>

<p>As I like I was saying, family is complicated, but everyone deals with their stress differently.</p>

<p>Now I"m just dedicated to school and work. I still visit my dad in Anaheim and the family friends we have over there.
I also just focus on my brother because he doesn't understand that soon I'm not going to be around as much. 
All I can say is that from here, I don't predict the future.</p>

<p>I started to work for Ruby's Diner in Anaheim since I was 16 years old, later on I transfered to the one in Redondo Beack. Many were surprised I could handle the restuarant enviroment because it's tiring if you work long shifts and demanding days. I knew I could handle it because my dad is a hard worker and my mom is stubborn. I guess you can say I am my parents daughter.</p>

  <h1>School</h1>
  <p>Most of my school work wasn't as demanding as work, but it was still hard. My classes this year just consist with filler periods. I still enjoy the work I do and my hard work gets payed off.</p>

  <h1>Anyways...</h1>
  <p>That's my life right there. I hope you learned something about me and my dedication to anything. Hope to see you soon.</p>
