  <h1>Portfolio</h1>
  <p>I started to work for Ruby's Diner in Anaheim since I was 16 years old, later on I transfered to the one in Redondo Beack. Many were surprised I could handle the restuarant enviroment because it's tiring if you work long shifts and demanding days. I knew I could handle it because my dad is a hard worker and my mom is stubborn. I guess you can say I am my parents daughter.</p>

  <h1>School</h1>
  <p>Most of my school work wasn't as demanding as work, but it was still hard. My classes this year just consist with filler periods. I still enjoy the work I do and my hard work gets payed off.</p>

  <h1>Anyways...</h1>
  <p>That's my life right there. I hope you learned something about me and my dedication to anything. Hope to see you soon.</p>
